# Explanations of Some Protocols' Banner

## Introduction

- What is Banner grabbing
  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_grabbing)
  - It is also a key technology of [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), according [here](https://help.shodan.io/the-basics/what-is-shodan)
- Plan
  - Due to some uncontrolled factors, there is a high probability that the raw data will not be updated
  - All existing data will be processed soon
- How to process dataset
  - [ ] For good demonstration effects in CSV, some banners will be processed
  - [ ] while some banners will remain NULL until find a good way to demonstrate
  - [ ] dataset in other format will be provided in the future (but readability for both human and machine may not as good as CSV)
- Issues surrouding the dataset
  - Raw dataset's readability is a disaster, because:
    - Banners in some protocols are HTML/XML-like structures
    - Some of remains are highly unstructured heterogeneous data
  - Office software like LibreOffice also cannot display correctly sometimes
