# Explanations of Some Protocols' Banner

## Introduction

- What is Banner grabbing
  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_grabbing)
  - It is also a key technology of [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), according [here](https://help.shodan.io/the-basics/what-is-shodan)
- Plan
  - Due to some uncontrolled factors, there is a high probability that the raw data will not be updated
  - All existing data will be processed soon
- How to process dataset
  - [ ] For good demonstration effects in CSV, some banners in the dataset will be processed
  - [ ] Some banners will remain NULL until find a good way to demonstrate
  - [ ] Dataset in other file format will be provided in the future (but readability for both human and machine may not as good as CSV)
- Issues surrouding the dataset
  - Raw dataset's readability is a disaster, because:
    - Banners in some protocols are HTML/XML-like structures
    - Some of remains are highly unstructured heterogeneous data
  - Office software like LibreOffice also cannot display correctly sometimes
  - GitHub cannot recognize and demonstrate the CSV file 

## 1. Basic information about Protocols in the Dataset

### IT ï¼°rotocols

- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

  A standard IT procotol, and it is also integrated in many interconnected devices
  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol)
  - [SNMP - Wireshark](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SNMP)
  - Main RFC(s): SNMPv1: RFC [1157](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1157) | SNMPv2c: RFC [1901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1901) to RFC [1908](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1908) | SNMPv3: RFC [3411](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3411) to RFC [3418](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3418)
